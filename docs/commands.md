`Command Reference`

 Here is a detailed list of all available commands in Abix.

---

### `abix init [especificações...]`

Creates the abix.json configuration file in the current directory.

**Usage:**
```bash
abix init [runtime:versão...] [--force]
```

**Behavior:**
*   If run without arguments  (`abix init`), it will try to detect if a`package.json` (for Node.js) or a`requirements.txt` (for Python) exists and create a default configuration.
*   You can specify exact runtimes and versions.
*   The`--force` flag will overwrite an existing`abix.json `without asking.

**Examples:**

### Automatic detection
```bash
abix init
```
### Specify only Node.js with version 20.11.0
```bash
abix init node:20.11.0
```

### Specify Node.js and Python, without quotes
```bash
abix init node:20.11.0 python:3.11.3
```

### Force overwrite of an existing abix.json
```bash
abix init node:22 --force
```

### `abix testar`

Checks the `abix.json` file, downloads the necessary runtimes (if not already cached), and installs the project's dependencies.


**Usage:**
```bash
abix testar
```
This is the ideal command to run after cloning a project or after making changes to abix.json. It ensures your environment is 100% ready for development.

---

### `abix shell`

Starts a new sub-shell (terminal) with the project's environment activated. Inside this shell, commands like `node`, `npm`, `python`, `pip`, etc., will use the versions specified in `abix.json`.

**Uso:**
```bash
abix shell
```
To exit the environment, simply type `exit`.

### `abix run`

Executes the entry point (`entry`) defined in your `abix.json`.

**Usage:**
```bash
abix run [argumentos adicionais...]
```

**Example `abix.json`:**
```json
{
  "runtimes": { "node": "20.11.0" },
  "entry": "node server.js"
}
```

**Execution:**
```bash
# Will execute "node server.js"
