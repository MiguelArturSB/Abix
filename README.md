### What is Abix?

Abix is a **zero-dependency** command-line interface (CLI) tool that manages Node.js and Python development environments in a fast and isolated way. Tired of NVM, pyenv, Conda, or the complexity of Docker for simple projects? Abix is the solution.

With a single executable file and a simple `abix.json`, you ensure that anyone on any operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux) can run your project with the correct tool versions, without needing to install anything else.

### ✨ Key Features

*   📦 **Zero Dependency:** Just one executable file. It doesn't require Node.js, Python, or any other tool to be pre-installed on the system.
*   🖥️ **Universal Cross-Platform:** Works identically on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
*   ⚡ **Fast with Smart Caching:** Runtimes are downloaded only once and are globally cached. Project dependencies are saved as "snapshots," making future setups nearly instantaneous.
*   📄 **Declarative Configuration:** Define everything your project needs in a single `abix.json` file.
*   🤖 **Auto-Detection:** The `abix init` command can detect if your project uses Node.js (`package.json`) or Python (`requirements.txt`) and create an initial configuration for you.
*   🛡️ **Secure:** Verifies the integrity (hash) of downloaded runtimes to ensure they have not been tampered with.

### 🚀 Quick Start

1.  **Download Abix:** Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/MiguelArturSB/Abix/releases) and download the executable for your system.

2.  **Set up PATH (Recommended):** To use the `abix` command from anywhere, follow our [**Installation Guide**](./docs/installation.md).

3.  **Initialize a Project:** Navigate to your project folder and run:
    
    #### Abix will try to detect your project (Node/Python)
    ```bash
    abix init
    ```

    #### Or specify the versions you want
    ```bash
    abix init node:20.11.0 python:3.11.3
    ```
    This will create an `abix.json` file.

4.  **Run:** Now, install the dependencies and run your project.
    
    #### Installs runtimes and dependencies, and tests the versions
    ```bash
    abix testar
    ```
    #### Enters a shell with the configured environment
    ```bash
    abix shell
    ```

    #### Or, if configured in abix.json, runs the project's entry point
    ```bash
    abix run
    ```

### Main Commands

| Command          | Description                                                 |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `abix init`      | Creates the `abix.json` configuration file in the project.  |
| `abix testar`    | Downloads runtimes and installs listed dependencies.        |
| `abix shell`     | Starts a new terminal with the project's environment activated. |
| `abix run`       | Runs the entry point (`entry`) defined in `abix.json`.      |
| `abix clean`     | Removes local files and folders generated by Abix.          |
| `abix setup`     | Shows instructions to add Abix to the system PATH.          |

➡️ For a detailed explanation of each command, check out the [**Command Reference**](./docs/commands.md).

### 💡 How It Works?

Abix centralizes all downloads in a `.abix` directory in your user's home folder. When you execute a command, it reads the `abix.json` file, builds a temporary `PATH` that prioritizes the isolated runtimes, and executes your command in that safe environment.
